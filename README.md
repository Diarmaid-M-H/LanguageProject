## What is this project
This is the code portion of my final year project, done in 2023-24. The project is about simulating Gaeilge usage by building models using Irish census data.
The full document which discusses the specifics at depth can be found [here](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/blob/13e930d317f270ca043bb063ce7e7aaac282377a/Final_Year_Project_Document.pdf).

## What models are used. 
Two macroscopic were used in the final version of the project. An [epidemiology model](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/blob/master/EpidemiologyModel.py) and a neural network [regression model](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/blob/master/Regressor.py). 

## Data sources
Data was sourced from Irish census data from the central statistics office. The data processing is discussed in the FYP document.
