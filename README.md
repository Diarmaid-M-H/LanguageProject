## What is this project
This is the code portion of my final year project, done in 2023-24 under the supervision of Dr Patrick Mannion. The project is about simulating Gaeilge usage by building models using Irish census data.
The full document which discusses the specifics at depth can be found [here](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/blob/13e930d317f270ca043bb063ce7e7aaac282377a/Final_Year_Project_Document.pdf).

## What models are used. 
Two macroscopic were used in the final version of the project. An [epidemiology model](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/blob/master/EpidemiologyModel.py) and a neural network [regression model](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/blob/master/Regressor.py). 

## Data sources
Data was sourced from Irish census data from the central statistics office. The data processing is discussed in the FYP document. 

## Outputs:
CSV files showing predictions for the next census can be found [here](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/tree/c769436a767f98d539dfe8ad105e4534bd366718/Output%20CSVs). Maps generated and outputted showing past data and predicted future data can be found [here](https://github.com/Diarmaid-M-H/LanguageProject/tree/c769436a767f98d539dfe8ad105e4534bd366718/maps). The predictions are also discussed in the FYP document.
